# CFDR: CFD-Rendering Toolkit

CFDR is a scientific data-visualization program developed and maintained by Matyas Constans,
with the primary aim to visualize simulation results in different ways in order to get
a good understanding of the data.

It was built on top of the [ALICE Engine](https://github.com/matt-const/alice), by the same author.

It is available both as a native desktop application and web-based visualization tool that can be
integrated in other workflows.

Visualizations can scripted and configured through it's own language (.CFDR files).

It was developed during the [HidALGO 2 project](http://hidalgo2.eu/), funded by the EU.
